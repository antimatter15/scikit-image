    the `u` value of the neighbouring pixel.

    Parameters
    ---------
    i1, j1, i2, j2: unsigned integers
        x and y indices of two diagonally adjacent pixels respectively.
    flag: ndarray of unsigned integers

    sol: float
        The `u` value for the pixel `(i2, j1)`. This represents the
        solution for the Eikonal equation.

    Comments
    ---------
    `u` which is used synonymously with `T` represents the Time taken by the
    boundary to reach that particular pixel in the grid. This is proportional
    to the distance between the boundary points and the point of interest.
    `T=0` represents the initial condition. And since the boundary is moving
    with a constant speed at all pixels in a direction normal to the boundary
    at all pixels, the time of arrival i.e. `u` or `T` must be monotonically
    increasing. This is an important requirement for the fast marching method
    to propagate ahead correctly.

    """Fast Marching Method implementation based on the algorithm outlined in
    Telea, A. (2004). *An Image Inpainting Technique based on the Fast Marching
    Method*. Journal of graphics tools, 9(1):23â€“34.

    Image Inpainting technique based on the Fast Marching Method implementation
    as described in the paper above. FMM is used for computing the evolution of
    boundary moving in a direction *normal* to itself. The tangential component
    of the velocity is not of interest here. This algorithm has been adapted by
    Telea for the purpose of inpainting. For this we assume that the speed is
    uniform at all the pixels and set it to 1. There are two phases to this
    implementation: the initialisation phase which is described in the
    `initialise` function and the propagation phase, which is described here.

    In order to obtain the correct representation it is important to propagate
    the boundary pixels to the interior (INSIDE) region in the increasing
    distance from the boundary. The solution to Eikonal equation helps
    achieve this.
    `|gradT| = 1`

    The steps of the algorithm are as follows:
    * Extract the pixel with the smallest `T` value in the BAND pixels. We use
            a priority heap implementation whose head is always the smallest
            value in the heap
        + `T[i, j] = heappop[0]`
    * Update its `flag` value as KNOWN
    * March the boundary inwards by adding new points.
            `for (k, l) in (i-1, j),(i+1, j), (i, j-1), (i, j+1)`
        + If they are either INSIDE or BAND, compute its `T` value using the
                `eikonal` function in all the 4 quadrants
        + If `flag` is INSIDE
            - Change it to BAND
            - Inpaint `(k, l)`
        + Select the `min` value and assign it as the `T` value of `(k, l)`
        + Insert this new value in the `heap`

    You can further check out the numerical approximation to the Eikonal
    equation and the algorithm in the paper.

    Parameters
    ---------
    image: ndarray of unsigned integers
        Input image padded by a single row/column on all sides
    flag: ndarray of unsigned integers
        Values are either 0 (KNOWN), 1(BAND) or 2(INSIDE)
    u: ndarray of float
        Consists of the `T` values of the pixels. 1.0e6 for pixel marked INSIDE
        else 0
    heap: list of tuples
        Priority Heap implementation based on the in-built Python`heapq` module
    negate: bool
        If `True` then used for initialising `u` values outside the BAND
        If `False` then used to inpaint the pixels marked as INSIDE
    epsilon: unsgned integer
        Neighbourhood of the pixel of interest

    Returns
    ------
    image: ndarray of unsigned integers
        Consists of the result after inpainting the all the pixels.
