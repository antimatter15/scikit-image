    """This function performs constrained texture synthesis. It grows the
    texture of surrounding region into the unknown pixels. This implementation
    is pixel-based. Check the Notes Section for a brief overview of the
    algorithm.

    Parameters
    ---------
    painted : (M, N) array, uint8
        Input image whose texture is to be calculated
    mask : (M, N) array, bool
        Texture for True values are to be synthesised
    window : int
        Size of the neighborhood window, (window, window)
    max_thresh : float
        Maximum tolerable SSD (Sum of Squared Difference) between the template
        around a pixel to be filled and an equal size image sample

    Returns
    -------
    painted : array, float
        Texture synthesised image

    Notes
    -----
    Outline of the algorithm for Texture Synthesis is as follows:
    - Loop: Generate the boundary pixels of the region to be inpainted
        - Loop: Generate a template of (window, window), center: boundary pixel
            - Compute the SSD between template and similar sized patches across
              the image
            - Find the pixel with smallest SSD, such that patch isn't where
              template is located (False positive)
            - Update the intensity value of center pixel of template as the
              value of the center of the matched patch
        - Repeat for all pixels of the boundary
    - Repeat until all pixels are inpainted
