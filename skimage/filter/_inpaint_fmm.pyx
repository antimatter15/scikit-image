    """Inpaint an image using the Fast Marching Method (FMM).

    Image Inpainting technique based on the Fast Marching Method implementation
    as described in [1]_. FMM is used for computing the evolution of boundary
    moving in a direction *normal* to itself.

    Parameters
    ---------
    image : array, float
        Initial input image padded by a single row/column on all sides.
    mask : array, bool
        Initial mask padded as the image, True values are inpainted.
    radius : int
        Neighbourhood of the pixel of interest.

    Returns
    ------
    painted : array, float
        The inpainted grayscale image.

    Notes
    -----
    The steps of the algorithm are as follows:
    - Extract the pixel with the smallest distance value (``u``) in the BAND
      pixels.
    - Update its ``flag`` value as KNOWN.
    - March the boundary inwards by adding new points.
        - If they are either UNKNOWN or BAND, compute its ``u`` value using the
          ``eikonal`` function for all the 4 quadrants.
        - If ``flag`` is UNKNOWN:
            - Change it to BAND.
            - Inpaint the pixel.
        - Select the ``min`` value and assign it as ``u`` value of the pixel.
        - Insert this new value in the ``heap``.

    For further details, see [1]_.

    -------
    u_out : float
        The ``u`` value for the pixel ``(i2, j1)``.

    Notes
    -----
    Often ``u`` is denoted as ``T`` and represents the distance/time map.
    The progression of the curve (boundary) follows an **upwind scheme**
    (refer [2]_) and in order to calulate ``u`` we find the perpendicular
    distance to the boundary (curve) from ``(i2, j1)`` using the difference in
    ``u[i1, j1]`` and ``u[i2, j2]``. Since the curve always travels normal to
    itself and with unit speed, the perpendicular distance also represents the
    time taken.

    This is represented by ``perp`` variable below. Add to this distance the
    time it has taken to reach the neighbouring KNOWN pixels. Represented
    below by ``s``. Hence, the time map always progresses ahead in time.
